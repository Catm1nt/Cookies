# Cookies
This is a Udacity Android programming for beginners project app.

How it should work:
When the user presses the EAT COOKIE -button in the UI, it changes the background picture and updates the TextView
to read "I'm so full!" instead of the original "I'm so hungry!" -text. The button is not hooked to revert these changes
when pressed a second time.
